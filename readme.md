# Hacker Mystery 95

![Icon](meta/HackerMystery-64.png)

This is my first attempt at a game! I honestly wouldn't be able to do this without Claude. I'm using Opus 4.5, working out a plan, and then letting it do most of the implementation. I do play testing and help it fix bugs, or do some manual tweaks where needed.

Its written in a legacy Javascript framework, called enyo, because it's being developed as a new game for Palm/HP's defunct webOS mobile platform -- while still retaining compatibility with newer browsers.

I've used Claude at work for light coding duties (mostly acceleration of grunt work) but this is my first time letting the AI really do most of the work, and the randomness makes it a lot of fun! The game is intended to be a mystery, but just like the user, neither Claude nor I know exactly what's going to happen: AI hallucinations + human creativity == who knows...?
